## Planning and Development:

The planning phase consisted of various elements which were modified as necessary while the project continued to evolve.

It all started with a wireframe and some user stories about what the TPSY web application should do. **At its heart it's an app to keep track of beers someone has tried, with a section to write a description and some notes of the beer**.

The back-end and front-end were set up with a somewhat barebones approach so that both elements existed in some form at the project's beginning. This was to better envision to project's development.

Most of the **back-end work was done earlier on**, focusing on creating models, routes and linking npm packages, middleware and other necessary components.

**The focus then shifted towards expanding on the front end** and linking together the front and back ends for seamless use.

With a working (albeit not visually pleasing) front end, development continued in the design/layout realm. The age to legally purchase and consume alcohol in the US is 21+ so it was decided **the web application should sport a 'mature' and 'modern' color scheme and layout theme**.

While the present version of TPSY focuses on beer, it was **intentionally designed as a flexible/open-ended web app**, able to introduce other beverages and expanded features/capabilities which may make an appearance in future versions.

### Possible features for future versions:

- Further formatting/styling considerations.
- Replacing the current action feedback system with a cleaner 'toast' system.
- Expanded mobile support.
- Expanded resources (wines, mixed drinks, etc).
- A 'favorites' system, or some other kind of rating system.
- The ability to get directions to (or just show on a map) the brewery that makes specific beers.
- A search bar so users can search using various parameters other than just the beer's ID as finding the ID can be cumbersome. The ID could then be omitted from the beer card.
- Further social media integration.
- Adding in user photos to beer cards.
- A beer 'bucket list' for a user to keep track of beers they want to try.
- A 'random beer' or 'pick a beer for me' button for the indecisive person who doesn't know what to buy. Alternatively a 'coin flip' type feature to help users decide which of two beers to buy.
